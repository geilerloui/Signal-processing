### 3.1.b The DFT as a change of basis

We will start with a finite-length signals (i.e. vectors in $\mathbb{C}^N$) to illustrate this, let's see a temporal signal, wheree we do not notice anything special.

And the same signal in the frequency domain with a proper change of basis

The Fourier basis will be

We claim that

We're going around the circle at each iteration, the second vector in the basis will be the second one



let's see a concrete example, with $N=64â€‹$, we look at the real and imaginary part of the vector when the vector rotate around the circle



the second basis vector



the bigger the N the more it is difficult to image a sinusoide, but even at 16 we still have a sinusoids

add many images
